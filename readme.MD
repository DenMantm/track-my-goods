Problem:
Your client, Transport Plus Ltd., have requested a new web application to track their vehicle fleet in real time. All their vehicles have been fitted with GPS and the vehicle configuration, i.e. tracking id, is stored in a SQL Server database. Transport Plus Ltd. want the new web app to provide secure login for their traffic controllers so they can view the position of each vehicle on a map.
The goal of this exercise is to design a skeletal code solution for this problem. Please also provide details on technical choices made, i.e. frameworks usage, model structures, etc. The provided code does not have to be functional.
It doesnâ€™t have to be fully functional. You are free to use any resource available, i.e. technical books, internet, The objective is to evaluate your problem solving skills and technical proficiencies

Solution:
Quick, requirement set
# User needs to be able to login to the system
# User needs to be able to logout of the system
# User has to be able to get list of available trucks from database
# User needs to be able to get location of the truck on the map
Technologies will be used used
For the fast, rapid development I will use:
Frontend: Angular2 Application
Styling: Bootstrap / Metro.css
Backend: Node.js API
My Angualr2 / Node.js Start repo will be used: https://github.com/DenMantm/angular2-node-quickstart

Transport Plus Ltd. want the new web app to provide secure login for their traffic controllers so they can view the position of each vehicle on a map.
The goal of this exercise is to design a skeletal code solution for this problem. Please also provide details on technical choices made, i.e. frameworks usage, model structures, etc. The provided code does not have to be functional.
It doesnâ€™t have to be fully functional. You are free to use any resource available, i.e. technical books, internet, The objective is to evaluate your problem solving skills and technical proficiencies

## Solution:
Quick, requirement set
- User can login to the system
- User can logout of the system
- User is able to get list of available trucks from database
- User can get location of the truck on the map
- User can view historical information
